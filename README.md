# Rogue Runes

**Rogue Runes** is a 2D top-down view dungeon crawler game, set in a medieval world filled with magic and wizardry. Inspired by the indie bullet hell game *Enter the Gungeon*, Rogue Runes takes a unique twist by focusing on spellcasting and runes instead of firearms.

## Game Overview

In *Rogue Runes*, players navigate through procedurally generated levels filled with challenging enemies and formidable bosses. The game begins with a tutorial level, accessible after clicking "Play," where players are introduced to the controls and mechanics of the game. Here, the player encounters a shop NPC who explains the basics and offers initial spells and items for purchase.

The tutorial also includes basic enemies for the player to test their initial spell and a mini-boss that drops better rewards, including "knowledge" (currency used to buy more powerful spells), health hearts, and a life potion to restore lost health.

## Key Features

- **Medieval Magic Theme**: Unlike Enter the Gungeon's gun-based gameplay, Rogue Runes is centered around magic and spellcasting, set in a richly designed medieval world.
  
- **Procedurally Generated Levels**: After completing the tutorial, players must navigate three procedurally generated levels, each with its own unique enemies and final boss.

- **Shop and Safe Zones**: At the end of each level, players return to a safe zone where they can upgrade their character, buy new spells, and prepare for the next challenge.

- **Persistent Spell Inventory**: While the player's health and progress reset upon death, their spell inventory remains intact, removing the need to repurchase previously acquired spells.

- **Challenging Progression**: Levels remain locked until the player defeats the boss of the current level, ensuring a challenging progression system.

## Gameplay Mechanics

- **Primary Weapon**: The player's main weapon is a staff, which remains constant throughout the game. The staffâ€™s power comes from the spells the player equips, which can be purchased from the shop.

- **Rewards and Knowledge**: Players earn rewards by defeating enemies and bosses, which can be used to enhance their abilities and unlock more powerful spells.

- **Dynamic Combat**: Engage in fast-paced combat with a variety of enemies, using a combination of skill, strategy, and magical abilities to survive.

## Objectives

- Explore procedurally generated levels without dying.
- Defeat enemies and bosses to accumulate rewards and knowledge.
- Purchase and upgrade spells to become more powerful.
- Progress through the levels by defeating bosses to unlock the next challenges.
- Survive and reach the end of the dungeon with your magical arsenal intact.

## Inspiration

Rogue Runes is deeply inspired by *Enter the Gungeon*, a game that I greatly enjoyed and admired for its innovative gameplay and creative design. This project is not only a technical and creative challenge but also an opportunity to expand my knowledge of game development and bring a unique vision to life.
